# BITCOIN-PREDICTION
This project uses a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict Bitcoin prices from historical data (open, close, high, low, volume). Built with Python, TensorFlow, and Keras, the model captures temporal patterns, offering promising results for time-series forecasting in volatile cryptocurrency markets.
